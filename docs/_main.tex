\hypertarget{instructor-recommendations}{%
\subsubsection*{Instructor Recommendations}\label{instructor-recommendations}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Instructor Recommendations}

The committee's initial report identifies teaching and learning as the most \emph{``immediate and significant GenAI application domain''} and provides guidance to instructors to help prepare for the Fall 2023 semester. The below sections include highlights of the guidance.

Generally, the committee finds that it is presently ``nearly impossible to enforce'' banning GenAI use in coursework. And therefore, strongly recommends that instructors consider the following questions when adapting course work:

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{open.png}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Should GenAI be used in the course or not---and why or why not?
\item
  If GenAI is to be used, how is the use to be documented?
\item
  Should course learning objectives be revised?
\item
  Should GenAI competencies be taught in the specific disciplinary context?
\item
  Should assessments be revised?
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{close.png}

\hypertarget{genai-permit-or-ban}{%
\paragraph*{GenAI: permit or ban?}\label{genai-permit-or-ban}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{GenAI: permit or ban?}

The report also addresses the fact that current academic misconduct definitions, Honor Codes, and academic integrity policies do not account for GenAI explicitly, and should be updated. The committee also acknowledges that students who use GenAI in an unauthorized manor may be committing cheating or plagiarism.

In determining GenAI permissability within academic misconduct policies, the report provides the following view:

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{open.png}

\begin{quote}
Common approaches to updating academic misconduct policies are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Determining that ChatGPT (or GenAI) is prohibited help from another ``person'' (e.g., UCLA),
\item
  Defining GenAI as a ``source'' that should be acknowledged (e.g., UW Madison).
\end{itemize}

The GAIA committee believes that the ``person'' approach misleadingly attributes sentience and a reasoning capacity to GenAI, and proposes that the ``source'' approach is more workable, and aligned with our mission of teaching students to engage effectively and ethically with the world around them.
\end{quote}

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{close.png}

With regard to course policy, the report provides the following guidance to instructors:

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{open.png}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  it is critical that expectations are clearly articulated in the syllabus and continually reinforced when assignments are given.
\item
  \textbf{instructors should be given flexibility to allow or disallow the use of GenAI tools. If the latter approach is adopted, the committee discourages the use of surveillance and plagiarism detection tools as they cannot be reliably counted upon at the present moment.}
\item
  GenAI is changing rapidly, and new tools will become available. Course policies therefore need to be provisional and subject to change.
\end{itemize}

Course policies might fall into one of three categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Specific uses of GenAI are encouraged (generating ideas, editing, translating, outlining).
\item
  Specific uses of GenAI are allowed if students clearly distinguish between their original work and GenAI output (highlighting output, tracking changes in GenAI output).
\item
  Any use of GenAI constitutes academic misconduct.
\end{itemize}

If GenAI tools are allowed, the instructor should be clear which tools are allowed and in what capacity. On the other hand, if GenAI tools are disallowed, the committee suggests that the instructor give reasons why the use of GenAI tools would hinder learning.
\end{quote}

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{close.png}

The report also suggests instructors review recommendations from \url{http://sentientsyllabus.org} for items to consider including in the syllabus.

\hypertarget{redesigning-coursework}{%
\paragraph*{Redesigning Coursework}\label{redesigning-coursework}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Redesigning Coursework}

The committee recommends that, out the outset, instructors become familiar with and practice using GenAI tools. For information regarding currently available tools, see section \ref{publicly-available-generative-ai}.

Once familiarized, the committee recommends that instructors consider the following with respect to their current course design:

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{open.png}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  What are the course objectives and rationale for them? Can GenAI be used to meet any of the objectives?
\item
  Are there new learning objectives in the areas of knowledge, skills, or values about GenAI that students need to meet? Will students have equitable access to GenAI for these objectives?
\item
  What tasks do students need to complete to demonstrate they meet the learning objectives?
\item
  How will learning be assessed?
\item
  Do the objectives, tasks, or assessments present problems with respect to equity, inclusion, diversity, or accessibility? If so, can they be adjusted to ensure fairness and inclusion?
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{close.png}

The committee recommends ``\textbf{that the course design should include some parts that cannot be completed satisfactorily (solely) by GenAI tools,} unless GenAI skills and values are the primary learning objectives.'' Moreover, \textbf{``Instructors are encouraged to try completing assignments using GenAI tools before distribut- ing assignments to students.''} The following guidance for how to adjust course design (summarized) is provided:

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{open.png}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Larger component of technology-free in-class assignments
\item
  Focus on higher-order thinking
\item
  Prioritize authentic instruction and assessment
\item
  Require accurate and verifiable citation of sources
\item
  Teach academic integrity

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    What do students need to learn and why
  \item
    What skills will students gain from using AI, what knowledge will they need to apply?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{close.png}

And the below decision tree is provided to help facilitate ``transparent assignment design''

\hypertarget{considerations-for-writing-intensive-courses}{%
\paragraph*{Considerations for Writing-intensive Courses}\label{considerations-for-writing-intensive-courses}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Considerations for Writing-intensive Courses}

For writing-intensive courses, the committee recognizes there are specific challenges to be addressed. Below is a summary of the guidance provided:

\includegraphics[width=0.3125in,height=0.20833in]{open.png}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  GenAI will transform traditional academic writing, multimodal/multimedia composition, and creative expression in every U-M school and college.
\item
  It is imperative that instructors continue to teach writing as well as multimedia/multimodal composition.
\item
  GenAI presents opportunities and potential benefits. It can be used at any point in the writing process to complement and expand students' thinking, project planning, brainstorming, research, outlining, drafting, and revision processes. There are risks involved in using GenAI in these ways: use of GenAI may impair original thinking and problemsolving; students' privacy is not protected; the output may contain fabrications, falsifications, biases, or errors. Students are nonetheless responsible for the work they turn in, including the truthfulness, academic integrity, and biases of content.
\item
  GenAI tools can be used as a cheating machine, so threats to academic integrity should be anticipated and mitigated in U-M's academic misconduct policies and in syllabus statements.
\item
  Instead of eliminating writing assignments, instructors should consider how they might adapt their goals for writing assignments to new GenAI environments.
\end{itemize}
