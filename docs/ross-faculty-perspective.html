<td>Beyond academic integrity, AI has disrupted other aspects of higher education. For example, fraudulent applications are a main concern. Admission essays could be written using AI tools, or applicants may hire consultants. This raises questions on the effectiveness of requiring admission essays and places more weight on direct interviews. During an interview, the applicant could be asked to define a made-up word, and the goal isn't to make up a definition but to admit that you do not know what it means. Increasingly, applications are becoming more about determining who's authentic. Historically, essay evaluation has been a long-standing issue, but the advent of GenAI compounds the problem. Everyone can look good on paper, but the intention behind essays is to understand an applicant’s traits and personality. As a response, interviews can carry more weight during our application evaluation.</td>

<td>ChatGPT is a great supplemental tool for teaching business analytics. This work in general requires a great deal of high-level synthesis and critical thinking skills. These are areas that ChatGPT does not provide much assistance. On the other hand, GenAI tools like ChatGPT can help students with the rote learning associated with advanced analytics, such as memorizing syntax and generating starter codes from which to work. All in all, these tools allow students to be more efficient in their learning, without compromising the ability to understand and solve problems in a practical sense. There are some concerns with low-level analytical courses such as undergraduate Excel classes where students can copy and paste directly from ChatGPT and generally score well. But intermediate and advanced analytical work within Excel or other tools requires a great deal of synthesis and abstraction, which are not strengths of GenAI tools.</td>

<td>GenAI is just another tool, and it is here to stay. We ought to get out in front of it and integrate it into our teaching. During a recent emergency faculty meeting, we discussed our response strategy to the proliferation of GenAI in higher education. A major concern was academic integrity. Specifically, for writing-intensive courses like those which I teach, a large concern is that students would submit their work through the dependent use of GenAI tools.</td>

<td><strong>Dr. John Silberholz</strong></td>
<td>GenAI is a positive development in academia. I don't see any concerns with the development of our students and the skills that they need to be successful in the workplace. The recent GenAI developments are akin to the rise of search engine prominence. Those who knew of the technology and understood how to use it benefited in the short term. But eventually, that advantage dissipates as the tool becomes more widespread in its use. The biggest challenge from an academic perspective is the ability to ensure equity of access to all students. This will be particularly challenging as these tools advance and become more specialized. In today's classroom, GenAI tools allow students to focus on higher learning principles that require critical thinking skills by offloading the mental capacity needed to process lower-level memorization work.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Dr. David Mendez</strong></td>
<td>GenAI has brought more opportunities than challenges to higher education. Inevitably, it is a tool that will be with all of us for the rest of our lives. We must learn to live in the AI world, and anticipate future developments. One significant challenge is that certain skills will no longer be marketable to employers, and we have to adjust how we prepare students to enter the workforce. Although it can be difficult to let go of past learning objectives, if ChatGPT can do it, why teach it? However, when it comes to coursework that involves critical thinking and problem-solving, GenAI poses no significant threat to learning objectives. Instructors need to be explicit at the start of the course and lay out the ground rules for GenAI tool use.</td>

<td>Instructors have to fundamentally change the way that they teach. GenAI tools are incredibly useful for developing solutions and will continue to be leveraged throughout society. Professors need to evaluate a student’s comprehension and ability to understand concepts through a dynamic and critical lens. Static representations of a student’s understanding are no longer acceptable means of demonstrating comprehension. There is an apparent rift between faculty that believe in changing the way they teach with new technology and those that do not.</td>

<td><strong>Dr. Ali Hojjat</strong></td>
<td>Academic integrity should be defined as incidents where individuals have access to resources that others didn't. As long thet access to GenAI tools remains consistent across the academic setting, it shouldn't be seen as a complicating factor contributing to an unfair disadvantage for one group against another. The greater risk to academic development lies within specific fields such as humanities and English, where a large portion of the curriculum overlaps with the core competencies associated with GenAI tools. To combat this, professors need to ensure that their coursework is delivered in a format that doesn't permit excessive use of online resources. It is important to make sure that the questions on exams and homework require critical thinking. In fact, in certain courses, GenAI is encouraged! I'd rather students spend less time memorizing coding syntax and more time developing critical business insight skills.</td>

<td><strong>Dr. John Branch</strong></td>
<td>Examples of academic integrity issues are common: the Community Values Committee manages new infractions every week. Even within BA500, we have seen cases of subpar performance due to GenAI dependence.  We are developing our policies to address these issues and, and are heading towards a future with fewer and fewer infractions.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Dr. John Silberholz</strong></td>
<td>The onus of academic integrity lies on the professors and revolves around their ability to create and structure a class that allows students to explore tools such as GenAIs, without compromising their conceptual understanding of the subject matter. In-person assessments that focus on critical thinking skills need to comprise the bulk of the graded work to ensure that students understand and can apply the learnings. Instructors should test their assignments using GenAI tools to evaluate if any learning objectives are compromised and place more emphasis on critiquing student outputs. Professors that don't revise their curriculum for the GenAI era will witness diminishing returns on their educational value. GenAI is not going away. Academia needs to take advantage of the new resources made possible by advancements in technology and adjust their content and teaching methods to account for the changing environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Dr. David Mendez</strong></td>
<td>Academic integrity issues are not new, and GenAI tools are not going to have a major effect on this topic. Even though there is no accurate way to detect usage, ChatGPT and other similar tools are not guaranteed to deliver coherent and correct answers. Anyone who uses these tools has to evaluate and improve the output before submitting a final answer. Professors evaluate students holistically, their writing voice from previous work, how they speak and interact in class, etc. As long as the student understands the information provided by the GenAI tool, he or she should be free to copy and paste directly from the source and use it without modification. It’s up to the professor to construct an evaluation process that doesn't slow down the learning process. If a student can speak intelligently about a topic and can participate in a socratic discussion, is a written essay really necessary to demonstrate understanding and application?</td>

<td>Higher education is an interesting beast. Professors have unique jurisdiction over their classes, specifically on whether using AI is allowed in their classes. There are lots of school policies in place, but in the end, it is the professors who are in charge. However, because of varied faculty opinions on how these tools should be used for coursework, it can lead to a frustrating student experience due to inconsistent guidelines.</td>

<td><strong>Dr. Ali Hojjat</strong></td>
<td>The value of tools like ChatGPT resides in the ability to focus on the "why" and less on the "dry" component of learning, such as syntax and manual calculation. Classes such as Python 101 should be taught in conjunction with ChatGPT, as GenAI tools such as programming co-pilots will be widely used within the workforce. In addition to the practical considerations of professional life, students can learn more, faster, and generate a greater level of understanding in a shorter amount of time when leveraging modern productivity-enhancing tools. Assignments should not be simply to summarize content, but they should require students to understand, review, edit, and clean up any GenAI output. Einstein once posited that the education system is set up to memorize facts, but the goal is to teach students how to think and analyze. If someone were to ask him "What's the speed of sound?" Einstein would respond that "I don't keep such information in my brain that is readily available in books."</td>

<td>For many years, education (business schools) have been struggling with isolation vs. integration. Isolation is defined as a topic so critical that it needs its own course - and an expert in the field should teach it. Integration is for learning objectives that should be in all courses due to universality - and assumes a degree of expertise in the professor. Some examples of previous hot topics that have this inflection point about integration or isolation have been globalization, corporate social responsibility, e-commerce, and more. So, it needs to be determined whether we create a new class or integrate it into all classes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Dr. John Silberholz</strong></td>
<td>GenAI tools solve the "blank page" problem, but they do not bring students to the highest level of understanding without critical thinking work that is currently beyond the limits of GenAI. These tools are best used to generate material as a starting point for an activity or assignment as they can handle prompts across an unlimited number of academic and professional disciplines. Despite their great efficacy and flexibility, these tools do not generate a final finished product worthy of scrutiny without additional and thoughtful work performed by its users. Instructors need to integrate GenAI into the coursework where it can add value. By experimenting with these tools while designing the curriculum, we can enhance and improve learning outcomes for students.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Dr. David Mendez</strong></td>
<td>GenAI tools can enhance the learning experience by allowing students to focus on critical thinking frameworks and problem-solving methodology. We also need to be cognizant of equitable access to avoid disparity. As the workplace continues to outsource repetitive tasks to AI, the requirement that students memorize or understand the minutiae of every task diminishes. If a GenAI tool can complete an assignment or perform a task at a passable level within a matter of seconds, then why ask our students to learn and develop those skills? In reality, most industries and professional settings dictate the use of time-saving and productivity-enhancing tools and constructs. Those who continue to perform non-value add tasks manually will eventually fall behind. Professors need to ask themselves whether they are asking students to acquire information for the sake of learning, or whether they are teaching students the skills and conceptual understandings needed to succeed in their futures.</td>

<td>Despite the rapid advancements in AI in the past few years, I don't expect GenAI tools to advance so quickly that within the next 5 years, we would witness a significant degradation in real-world skills caused by the proliferation of GenAI tools and capabilities. Entry-level job duties will most likely shift during this time, and academia will have to adjust accordingly. As teaching and learning models adapt to the changes in technology, certain skills become less and more useful. As long as teachers and students adapt and focus on the learning outcomes needed to perform effectively in the workforce, we shouldn't be concerned about the negative effects of GenAI tools.</td>

<td>Currently, I don't envision Generative AI as a major threat to the way people learn and process information. GenAI is essentially a pattern-matching tool that predicts the next best possible word based on some input text. It only has the ability to re-combine old information in a manner that it perceives to be beneficial. This is different from General AI which possesses the ability to mimic human thinking. The watershed moment in academic and human history will occur when advancements in General AI allow these programs to replace the basic cognitive reasoning skills which currently differentiate man from machine.</td>

<p>Based on our interviews with faculty and staff at the Ross School of Business, while there is a need for change in the way that educators need to teach with the use of AI by the student population, we must also acknowledge that instructors are autonomous in how they decide to shape their courses and policies. There needs to be a greater consensus by the school as a whole to avoid complications between classes as students utilize this tool because of its efficiency, competency, and overall value that it adds to the day-to-day learning process.</p>
<p>Among the recurring themes, it has been emphasized that detecting AI-generated content, particularly in Generative AI, poses a challenge for educators that believe it violates academic integrity in their classes. Specifically, there are heightened risks for writing-intensive, humanities courses, but more opportunities and possibilities for more technical disciplines, illustrating how divisive this powerful tool can be.</p>
<p>A noticeable divide has become evident between faculty members who enthusiastically embrace AI’s potential and those who have reservations about its use, highlighting the need for constructive dialogue across the school to bridge this gap. As we progress, it is evident that education must adapt to the evolving technological landscape. The use of AI as a tool for students and educators alike will only increase, and so there is a dire need for steps toward this evolution in teaching methodologies to prioritize conceptual comprehension over rote memorization. Students need to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills as future business leaders in a digitized era, rather than regurgitation of information that will become generally useless after the class has ended.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a consensus that AI will only improve as investment skyrockets into the new technology. As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of AI, the Ross School of Business is poised to harness its benefits while navigating the nuances and challenges that come with this transformative tool in business education and at the University of Michigan as a whole.</p>
