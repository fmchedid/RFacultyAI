# Final Thoughts

The potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence is here. This report delves into the transformative influence of GenAI on business education, drawing insights from extensive faculty and staff interviews, exploring the capabilities of particular GenAI tools, and contextualizing them within the broader framework of university policies through the findings of the GAIA committee.

The insights gathered from interviews with faculty and staff highlight the diversity of perspectives surrounding the use of AI tools in education. While some embrace its potential to reshape teaching and engagement, others raise valid concerns about academic integrity and the need for a balanced approach. The disparity between faculty members who embrace AI's potential and those who exhibit caution underscores the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration. This will foster an environment where educators collectively shape the future of education, leveraging AI to elevate critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity among students. As AI technologies continue to advance, it is imperative for the Ross School of Business to establish a collaborative discourse, promoting an atmosphere that allows for a unified approach to this groundbreaking technology.

Our investigation into the GAIA committee's findings underscores the University of Michigan's proactive stance in understanding and regulating the integration of GenAI into its educational framework. The emergence of a UMich-based ChatGPT competitor further exemplifies the institution's commitment to innovation and adaptability. It is essential for the University to continue fostering an environment that encourages experimentation and collaboration to effectively harness the potential of AI in a responsible and constructive manner.

This discussion of AI between educators and students alike at the University of Michigan must emphasize a balanced and informed approach to its integration---one that prioritizes a modern education for students while also maintaining academic integrity standards assumed by instructors. By establishing guidance that helps the community navigate the complexities of AI while also capitalizing on the vast opportunities that it presents within education, the Ross School of Business can initiate an era of education that is both enriched and elevated by the transformative power of GenAI.
