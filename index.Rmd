# Introduction

In an era of rapid technological advancement, Artificial Intelligence stands as a transformative force with the potential to reshape academia. Generative AI (GenAI) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a diverse array of applications, ranging from natural language generation to content creation, problem-solving, and even creative arts. As we stand at the beginning of a technological revolution that will reshape many aspects of our world, it becomes imperative to assess the potential ramifications within the context of higher education. This guide-book explores how GenAI will influence education at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business---focusing on implications directly related to the school's faculty and staff.

Our project begins with faculty interviews that provide a comprehensive range of perspectives, highlighting its potential to reshape the traditional role of teaching, redefine teacher-student relationships, and rethink what should be prioritized in educating business leaders of the future. By tapping into the collective wisdom of our esteemed faculty, we seek to uncover insights and current perspectives on the use of GenAI, considering its role in curriculum, academic integrity, and its overall implications for the future of education at the Ross School of Business.

We also assess current university guidance, providing a backdrop for evaluating GenAI adoption. By critically analyzing the existing guidelines and resources within the University of Michigan, we aim to shed light on the framework within which our university will operate into the foreseeable future.

Finally, by examining GenAI's current capabilities and real-world uses. We explored a multitude of AI-driven content generation, seeing it firsthand across a wide range of both creative and more structured disciplines.

This book aims to provide faculty with resources for guidance and varying perspectives in hopes to guide our faculty to leverage AI's potential while addressing the multitude of potential considerations. In relation to business education, we aim to provide a roadmap for faculty members to navigate the ever-evolving landscape with insight, foresight, and adaptability. By embracing the power of GenAI, the Ross School of Business has the potential to enhance, enrich, and modernize the educational experience of current and future students.
