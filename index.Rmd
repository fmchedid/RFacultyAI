# Introduction

In an era of rapid technological advancement, Artificial Intelligence stands as a transformative force with the potential to reshape academia. Generative AI—driven by cutting-edge models like OpenAI's GPT-3—has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a diverse array of applications, ranging from natural language generation to content creation, problem-solving, and even creative arts. As we stand at the base of a technological revolution that will reshape many aspects of humanity, it becomes imperative to assess its potential ramifications within the context of higher education. This analysis explores how generative AI will influence education at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business—focusing on its impact on the school's faculty and staff.
Our project begins by examining generative AI's current capabilities and real-world uses. We explored a multitude of AI-driven content generation, seeing it firsthand and exploring its implications for fostering innovation and efficiency across a wide range of both creative and more structured disciplines.

Faculty interviews provide a comprehensive range of perspectives, from optimism to caution, highlighting its potential to reshape the traditional role of teaching, redefine teacher-student relationships, and rethink what should be prioritized in educating business leaders of the future. By tapping into the collective wisdom of our esteemed faculty, we sought to uncover insights and current perspectives on the use of generative AI, considering its role in curriculum, academic integrity, and its overall implications for the future of education at the Ross School of Business. These conversations spanned a range of perspectives, from cautious optimism to enthusiastic embrace for its potential.

We also assess university policies, providing a backdrop for evaluating generative AI adoption. By critically analyzing the existing guidelines and resources within the University of Michigan, we aimed to shed light on the regulatory framework within which our university will operate into the foreseeable future. Some examples of such are the Generative AI Advisory (GAIA) Committee and the creation of a UMich-based ChatGPT competitor for potential use within the university. This assessment serves as a crucial backdrop against which we evaluate the potential opportunities and challenges associated with generative AI adoption.

Our project concludes by distilling faculty insights, university policies, and current applications of generative AI into practical recommendations—guiding our faculty to leverage AI's potential while addressing ethical, pedagogical, and general institutional considerations. In summation, this serves as a guide through generative AI's impact on business education, providing a roadmap for faculty members to navigate the ever-evolving landscape with insight, foresight, and adaptability. By embracing the power of generative AI, the Ross School of Business has the potential to enhance, enrich, and modernize the educational experience of current and future students.
